# Theutoland

Theutoland is a grassy region with a temperate climate though slightly harsher winters. It is the ancestral homeland of the Theutolanders, whose ancestors would soon cover the subcontinent of Teumania. With the arrival of the [[steel|Steel Era]], the Theutolanders are usually referred to as [[steel/carowiga|Carowigans]].
