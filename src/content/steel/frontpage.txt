# Steel Era

The Steel Era spans from 1000 to 1500 AUC. It was originally named due to the harsh and tough connotations of the word "steel", but it is now used to refer to the period of history in which steel production was widespread and used in industry and warfare; in reality, steel production was already known in the [[golden/frontpage|golden period]], but developments in metallurgy and the widespread use of steel in industry and warfare have made the name stick around.
